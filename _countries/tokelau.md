# Tokelau

Tokelau is a remote New Zealand territory in the South Pacific, consisting of three coral atolls: Atafu, Nukunonu, and Fakaofo.  
It is one of the most isolated places on Earth, with no airport and access only by boat from Samoa.

Travel here is rare and tightly regulated, making Tokelau more of a conceptual destination than a practical one.
